# 21_GitHub_OpenSourceChallenge
OpenSource Challenge a 21 Day immersive Experience.
This is the First Day of learning a few basic concepts of GitHub and I would like to share them here probably the basics like dashboard, profiles, repositories, pull Requests, and along with that the concept of repository and how a few Markdowns are being done in a GitHub repository and why do we use them if needed !!
## What and Why is GitHub used for?
GitHub is generally used in making work simple for people who wants to collaborate and it eases work load for people who are far away and wanted a connecting platform helping us in showing every commit that we pull in a detailed manner and this is what makes it different from other platforms. And that is a collaborative software development which is built upon Git version control System. And here I would like to highlight its Key uses and Benefits such as:
### Version Control and Code Hosting
### Collaboration and Teamwork
### Code Review and Quality Assurance
### Project Managemen
### Open-Source Development
### Community and Networking
### Accessibility and Portability
and all this code is beign stored in a repository 
## Repository 
a place where are the files are being stored and shows what a project contains and probably every detail of it. And version control which means it has a track of everything which helps us know who had given a new approach or who made the changes neccessary and every move is being noted.
## Issues:
A system for tracking tasks, bugs, and enhancements within a project, allowing for discussion, assignment, and linking to code changes.
## Pull Requests (PRs):
A mechanism for proposing changes from one branch to another, facilitating code review, discussion, and collaborative integration of new features or bug fixes.
## Branches and Commits:
Within a repository, development can occur on different "branches" to isolate changes. "Commits" are snapshots of the repository at specific points in time, recording the changes made.
## Before starting with these repositories We have to learn what are the terms that makes the repository.
Branch -	A parallel version of your code that is contained within the repository, but does not affect the primary or main branch.
Clone -	To download a full copy of a repository's data from GitHub.com, including all versions of every file and folder.
Fork -	A new repository that shares code and visibility settings with the original "upstream" repository.
Merge -	To take the changes from one branch and apply them to another.
Pull request -	A request to merge changes from one branch into another.
Remote -	A repository stored on GitHub, not on your computer.
Upstream -	The branch on an original repository that has been forked or cloned. The corresponding branch on the cloned or forked repository is called the "downstream."
